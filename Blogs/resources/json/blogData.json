        "description": "Developed a contact form using React.js with integration of the Web3Forms API. The contact form allows users to submit their name, email, phone number, and message. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the Web3Forms API, which handles the backend processing and sends the form data to the specified email address. Implemented error handling to display success or error messages based on the API response. Used React Hooks for state management and form submission handling. A straightforward and efficient solution for creating a contact form with email integration in React applications.",
